# Language Classification Model

## Introduction
The **Language Classification Model** is built to classify language based on the input. Its core part is a RNN constructed with Pytorch

## Dataset
- You can access the data by this [link](https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip/).
- Preprocessing steps include eliminating unuseful data, creating a hash table, splitting data for training. 

## Model and Algorithm
- RNN model built using Pytorch.
- Create a hash table for languages and characters for better model recognition.

## Acknowledgments
- Special thanks to the creators of open-source datasets in this project.
